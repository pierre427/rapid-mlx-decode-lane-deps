"""One place that decides the megakernel's settings, and says where each came from.

Before this module there were three kinds of number in the build and no way to
tell them apart from the outside: values an operator set (``THREADS`` from the
environment), values a measurement produced (``T=512``, ``G=40``, the per-phase
row counts), and values that were simply true of an M5 Max (40 threadgroups is
40 GPU cores).  All three arrived as module constants.  A run could not state
which of its settings were chosen for it and which were inherited from a
different machine.

``resolve()`` answers that.  Every setting comes back as a value *and* a
source, in a fixed precedence:

1. **env** -- an explicit environment variable.  An operator overrides
   everything, including a calibration, because that is what an override is
   for.
2. **cache** -- a measurement for THIS device signature, from the autotune
   cache (``qwen4_megakernel_tune``).
3. **probe** -- derived from what the device reports.  ``G`` is the GPU core
   count scaled to the measured 512-threads-per-core residency budget, so the
   geometry follows the chip instead of the chip we tuned on.
4. **shipped** -- the phase-B M5 Max measurement, used when the probe cannot
   read what the derivation needs.

``portability_refusal()`` is the other half.  The build's caps were tuned, not
checked: 512 threads is under this device's 1024 limit and the 16 KiB
threadgroup budget is under its 32 KiB arena, and neither fact was ever
asserted.  On a part with a smaller arena, a smaller threadgroup, or less
memory than the model needs, the first evidence today is a compile failure, an
allocation failure, or a wrong answer. Each becomes a named refusal before the
full megakernel body and its persistent ledgers are allocated or launched.

**Environment variables** (all optional; the megakernel is default OFF):

``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL``
    ``1``/``on`` to enable the path at all.  Read by ``qwen4_megakernel``.
``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL_THREADS``
    Threads per threadgroup.  Explicit; beats the cache and the probe.
``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL_GROUPS``
    Threadgroups in the persistent grid.  Explicit; beats the cache and probe.
``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL_SPIN_CAP``
    Grid-barrier spin cap before a threadgroup declares the grid non-resident.
``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL_ROWS``
    Per-phase rows per simdgroup as ``name=rows,name=rows`` (for example
    ``moe_down=2,gdn_in_proj=2``).  Names are the keys of ``PHASE_ROWS``.
    **Resolved and reported, not yet consumed**: ``build_body_kernel`` still
    takes its row counts from its own defaults, so this setting reaches the
    receipt and not the kernel.  Wiring it is one keyword at that call site
    and is deliberately left to the phase-E rewrite of the body, which owns
    that file today.
``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL_THREADGROUP_BYTES``
    Threadgroup arena budget in bytes.  The 16 KiB default is a residency
    choice (two threadgroups per core), not the hardware limit.
``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL_GPU_CORES``
    Core count for a machine whose IORegistry cannot be read.
``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL_TUNE``
    ``auto`` (default) calibrates once per signature and yields the timing
    sweep to whoever holds the GPU lease; ``off`` skips the sweep but still
    runs the primitive tests; ``skip`` touches nothing at all; ``force``
    re-runs both and ignores the lease.
``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL_TUNE_CACHE``
    Path of the tuning cache JSON.  Default
    ``~/.cache/mlx-megakernel/megakernel-tune.json``.
``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL_TUNE_BUDGET_S``
    Wall-clock budget for a calibration sweep.  Default 120 s.
``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL_TUNE_BUSY_PATH``
    A lease path that DEFERS the timing sweep while it exists.  Default is
    the lab GPU lease directory; empty disables the check.
``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL_TUNE_ADOPT``
    ``1`` lets the sweep's winner OVERRIDE the probe rule.  Off by default:
    on the one machine where the real per-token answer is known, the proxy
    chose a grid the real mix measures 13% slower, so the sweep is recorded
    and the rule stands -- except where the rule has no answer at all (an
    unreadable core count), where a measured candidate is adopted.
``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL_REQUIRE_PRIMITIVES``
    ``1`` (default) refuses the kernel on a signature whose grid-barrier and
    device-scope fence tests have not passed here.  ``0`` is an escape hatch
    for bringing up a new part, and says so on the receipt.
