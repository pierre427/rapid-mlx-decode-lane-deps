"""Default-off persistent per-token decode megakernel for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next.

One dispatch per token.  The layer chain runs inside it as a sequence of
phases separated by the grid-wide device-scope barrier settled by the
2026-09-03 feasibility spike, replacing ~1,500 dependent dispatches at a ~9 us
GPU-side floor with a handful of long-running launches.

Nothing here runs at import time.  ``MLX_QWEN4_MEGAKERNEL`` defaults OFF and
admission fails closed.

Three structural decisions, and why.

**The phase dispatcher reads a device-visible schedule, it is not unrolled.**
The alternative -- emitting 48 layers x ~12 phases of straight-line MSL -- was
rejected on three counts.  The source would be ~600 phase bodies, so compile
time and the shader cache grow with the layer count; the binary would
re-specialise on every layer-type mix, so the MTP head (one full-attention
layer) could not share it; and the usual argument FOR unrolling does not apply
here.  That argument is register pressure: a single dispatch has ONE register
allocation whichever way it is written, and the spike measured the residency
ceiling as a thread/register budget (~2,048 threads/core), so a 48-layer kernel
must fit its worst phase's occupancy either way.  What unrolling would buy is
constant address arithmetic, and the offset table already reduces that to one
indexed load per phase against a 2.1--5.2 us barrier.  The schedule buffer also
puts the barrier map -- which phase boundary needs a device barrier and which
needs only a threadgroup barrier -- in DATA, so adopting a tuned map is a
host-side change rather than a kernel edit.

**Scratch is ping-ponged, never written in place.**  The spike's U2 result is
that the first cross-threadgroup handoff of an address is correct even at
threadgroup scope and every later REUSE of that address is stale.  A persistent
kernel reuses the same scratch every phase of every layer, so device scope is
mandatory, and any phase that both reads and writes the residual streams writes
to the other slab.

**Admission fails closed.**  ``M != 1`` is refused at first: batch and
speculative lanes come later.

#   at each of the two boundaries stock rounds at (norm out, rope out).  The
#   bf16 round is not cosmetic: the attention phase's bit-identity with the
#   shipped indexed kernel holds only if ``q`` is exactly ``float(bf16 q)``.
# * ``OP_KV_APPEND`` -- ``cache.update_and_fetch(k, v)`` plus
#   ``cache.update_index_keys(raw)``.  It writes the KV ledger and the raw
#   index-key ledger IN PLACE through their bindings, the same const_cast the
#   grid barrier already makes on ``ctrl``: a decode token appends one column,
#   and a phase that returned it as an output would put the host back between
#   two phases of the same launch.
# * ``OP_POOL_BLOCK`` -- ``QSAIndexer._pool_blocks`` for the ONE block a decode
#   token can close.  Phase B left pooling on the host, in the PLE class.  It
#   cannot stay there: ``n_blocks = total // compress_ratio`` counts the
#   current token, so every 4th token scores a block whose keys were written
#   by the same launch.  Mean over the block in fp32 (the stock cast order),
#   k_layernorm, then RoPE at the block's START position.
# * ``OP_GATE_MUL`` -- ``out * mx.sigmoid(gate)``, the second half of q_proj's

# T=512/G=40 instead of T=256/G=80 gives the hyper phase its wider threadgroup
# (2.405 ms vs 2.752 for 96 mixers, -12.6%) and costs the chain nothing --
# 3.963 ms vs 4.050 at K=24, i.e. the chain is 2% FASTER, not hurt.  Per block:
# GDN 62.1 us (best anywhere is 60.1 at T=512/G=80, so +3.3%), MoE 90.6 us
# (the best of the whole table), hyper +8.3% off its own optimum -- and that
# residual is a G difference, which is equally fixed per dispatch, so no
# per-phase escape exists for it either.
#
# Per-phase threads is NOT available as a lever: Metal fixes the threadgroup
# size per dispatch, so the only in-dispatch alternative is to let a phase use
# part of its threads and idle the rest.  Measured lower bound on that: the
# T=256/G=40 row is exactly the same active work as a half-idle T=512/G=40
# phase but WITHOUT the idle lanes' register cost, and it is 22.6% worse on the
# chain (4.859 vs 3.963) and 24.2% worse on hyper (2.988 vs 2.405).  A real
# half-idle phase can only be worse than that.  So: never idle lanes.
#
# G=40 is BELOW the 48 GDN value heads.  That is the spike's silent-wrong-answer
