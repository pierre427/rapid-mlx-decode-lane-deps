"""Calibrate the megakernel on a machine it has never run on, then remember.

Two different things happen here, and they answer two different questions.

**The primitive tests answer "is the kernel legal here at all".**  The grid
barrier is not a documented Metal guarantee -- it is a spin over device-scope
atomics that works because threadgroups happen to be co-resident, and the
feasibility spike measured its ceiling as a THREAD budget (~2,048 per core,
i.e. the barrier completes at G=40/80 at T=512 and aborts cleanly above it).
The device-scope fence is the same kind of fact: 0 stale words in 1.024e9 word
reads WITH the fence, ~99.98% stale without.  Both were measured on one chip.
Neither transfers.  So a signature that has not passed them here does not run
the kernel -- ``qwen4_megakernel_config.portability_refusal`` turns a missing
or failed primitive result into a named refusal.

**The sweep answers "which geometry is fastest here".**  It is deliberately
small: a chain of barrier-separated phases run at a bounded set of (threads,
threadgroups) and then at a bounded set of rows-per-simdgroup at the winner.

Its shape is NOT arbitrary, and the first version of it got the answer wrong.
A pure 4-bit matvec chain -- the dominant cost class -- preferred 1024 threads
per core at every threadgroup width on this machine (0.390 ms at T=512/G=80
against 0.492 at the shipped T=512/G=40), while the per-token measurement that
chose the shipped geometry says G=80 is 13% SLOWER.  The proxy was missing the
two things that decided it: a phase whose parallelism is capped (the GDN core
has 48 value heads, so a grid wider than 48 pays the barrier for idle
threadgroups) and, above all, that phase's PER-THREAD REGISTER FOOTPRINT --
Metal allocates registers for the whole kernel, so one phase holding 64 floats
a thread costs occupancy in every other phase.  The workload therefore carries
a fourth phase that does both.  A proxy without it recommends a geometry that
makes this machine slower, which is the whole failure mode this layer exists
to avoid.

It is still a starting point for an unknown part, not a replacement for the
tuning round that produced the shipped numbers -- and the receipt says
``cache`` so nobody mistakes one for the other.

Both results go into a JSON cache keyed by the device signature.  A later load
reads the cache and launches nothing.  The cache is advisory in exactly one
direction: it can choose a geometry, and it can REFUSE one, but it can never
make a kernel run that the primitive tests did not clear.
